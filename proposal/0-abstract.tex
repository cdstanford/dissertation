\begin{abstract}
The sheer scale of today's data processing needs, the emergence of the internet of things, and the increasing transience of data have led to the popularity of specialized software systems centered around requirements for high-throughput, distributed, low-latency computation. Despite their widespread adoption, \emph{stream processing systems (SPS)}, such as Apache Flink, Timely Dataflow, and Apache Spark Streaming, remain challenging for end users due to \emph{unpredictability} in the implementation with respect to the user program. In particular, formal guarantees are absent, resulting in correctness and performance bugs. We propose new programming abstractions towards predictable programming for stream processing systems. Our contributions span the dimensions of \emph{semantics, testing, distribution,} and \emph{monitoring} for SPS. We report on the implementation of research artifacts towards making these ideas a practical reality, including the DiffStream and DGSStream tools. Finally, as future work, we propose a \emph{formally verified} library for programming over SPS.
