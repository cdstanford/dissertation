\begin{abstract}
The sheer scale of today's data processing needs, the emergence of the internet of things, and the increasing transience of data have led to the popularity of specialized software systems centered around requirements for high-throughput, distributed, low-latency computation. Despite their widespread adoption, \emph{distributed stream processing systems (DSPS)}, such as Apache Flink, Timely Dataflow, and Apache Spark Streaming, remain challenging for end users due to unexpected behavior at runtime. In particular, formal guarantees are absent, resulting in correctness and performance bugs. We propose new programming abstractions towards \emph{reliable} programming for DSPS. Our contributions span the dimensions of \emph{semantics, testing, distribution,} and \emph{monitoring} for distributed stream processing programs. A subset of these ideas are implemented and available for end users in the DiffStream and DGSStream tools. As future work, we envision a library providing \emph{verification} of programs built upon these abstractions.
