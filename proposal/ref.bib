EdgeWise: This is a stream processing engine for the edge. The focus of this paper, is the
work scheduling, and their point is that current state of the art SPEs are agnostic to
congestion and the limited resources of edge devices. The claim that all the research
that has been done in databases about operator scheduling is completely ignored in SPEs.

They implement their system on top of Storm, by implementing a congestion-aware scheduler
that has better throughput and latency than Storm in both theory and practice.

Conclusion: This is amazing work, that is however orthogonal to our work. It is actually
complementary, as we could use ideas from their paper to implement our optimization/
distribution module.

Notes:
 - They use an IoT benchmark to measure performance against storm, which might be helpful.
 - Also we might be able to use some of their references or arguments about why standard
   stream processing engines are not adequate for edge processing.

Several solutions, including multiple software engines, have been developed for processing unbounded data streams in a scalable and efficient manner. More recently, architecture has been proposed to use edge computing for data stream processing. This paper surveys state of the art on stream processing engines and mechanisms for exploiting resource elasticity features of cloud computing in stream processing. Resource elasticity allows for an application or service to scale out/in according to fluctuating demands. Although such features have been extensively investigated for enterprise applications, stream processing poses challenges on achieving elastic systems that can make efficient resource management decisions based on current load. Elasticity becomes even more challenging in highly distributed environments comprising edge and cloud computing resources. This work examines some of these challenges and discusses solutions proposed in the literature to address them."

  pages={168--178},
  year={2016},
  organization={IEEE}
}

SpanEdge: This paper focuses on the same problem as we do. They introduce an extension
to the standard stream processing graph model, by allowing users to group local tasks,
so that they can be ran locally. They also implement a scheduler to optimally
distribute applications among central and near-the-edge data centers.

The main shortcoming compared to our work, is that since they build on top of the standard
stream processing graph abstraction, they don't offer any correctness guarantee. More
precisely in their case, grouping tasks in local, and sending them to be executed close
to the data, could lead to bugs, and there is no straightforward way, of finding out
whether it is indeed correct doing so.

Notes:
 - In their related work, they have a small section on Distributed algorithms for
   Streaming Data. These algorithms seem to try to do some computation without
   aggregating all data in a central location. It will be super-interesting to
   implement some of them in our framework, so that we can show that it is possible
   and easy to implement stuff in it.
 - It is certainly worth comparing against them, as we are trying to solve the same
   problem. So if we manage to get comparable performance, but correctness guarantees,
   we get a very good result.
 - They call communication to and from the datacenter WAN communication. Maybe we
   can also use that terminology? They also cite some work that mentions why WAN
   bandwidth can be expensive and scarce. Use it maybe?
 - Their evaluation seems very bad, since they don't mention anything about the
   centralized architecture that they compare against, as well as because they
   perform the task in an emulator, and so they simulate the computation by dropping
   random incoming tuples(?).

Data Driven Stream Processing at the Edge: They claim that the contribution
is a programming framework that allows the computation to exploit data location.
They propose an architecture that fits the framework, which (from my understanding)
can be described as follows. Each node has a Kafka and a Storm instance. The
proposed framework, offers communication primitives, that allow the user to setup
the connections between these different nodes, and receive their events etc. If I
understand correctly the point is that seting up connections is not done by explicitly
connecting to nodes, but rather by subscribing to streams etc.

It is not clear, how does the frameowork look, and how does one specify these
connections. It seems that this is a relatively low level system, in the sense
that the user has to themselves setup what events they care about, and then
process them.

It is not clear how a program written in this framework can be reasoned about
and whether it is easy to do so.

They have implemented their system on top of Kafka and Storm.

Notes:
 - They have a two part evaluation. Scalability experiments, like we do,
   together with a comparison against a centralized architecture. Since
   they have implemented their system on top of Storm and Kafka, it is
   relatively straightforward to compare against them.

Programming Wireless Sensor Networks: 

This is a sruvey of the state of the art approaches for programming WSNs.
I think that we could cite it, and maybe take a look at it to make sure that
there is no programming model that is the same as ours. We can also see
where our model falls in these categories (even though I think their
categorization is a bit arbitrary).

They mention, that initially, WSNs became popular in sensing applications,
where the sensors collect data and route them to a central node. However,
now there are a lot of Sense-and-react applications where the logic is
embedded in the network.

An important problem as they mention is mobility. Nodes might be mobile.

They describe that the programming models can be separated into 2 categories.
The node-centric and the macroprogramming ones. Node centric are supposed to
be from the perspective of each node whereas macroprogramming seems to imply
that one describes the behaviour of the whole network. Flumina seems to be
in both categories, as one describes the sequential computation, but then
hints how distribution happens in a node by node level.

They propose a more fine-grained separation based on language and architectural
aspects.

- One of the interesting language aspects is the communication addressing,
  which describes how does one write the address of a receiver in the
  programming framework. Do they write a physical receiver address, or
  is the receiver found based on some implicit way (such as the type of
  the message)

- Implicit or explicit communication. Whether the user handles low level
  buffering, transmission etc.

- Imperative or Declarative.

The description of all systems starts at page 36.

Out of them this: "SNBENCH:Programming and Virtualization Frameworkfor 
Distributed Multitasking Sensor Networks" seems to be one of the related ones,
in the sense that it is a high level programming framework, where one
describes jobs happening at different nodes, and then describes how to
aggregate them. It is nothing near to our work, but it is related in a broad sense.

An important note: They claim that there hasn't been a lot of work on fault
tolerance, and that most of these programming models offer little to no
support when this happens. The best thing one can hope for is writing
an application specific way to handle errors.

%%% ===== APPROACH 3: APPROXIMATION =====

@inproceedings{zhang2018awstream,
  title={Awstream: Adaptive wide-area streaming analytics},
  author={Zhang, Ben and Jin, Xin and Ratnasamy, Sylvia and Wawrzynek, John and Lee, Edward A},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SIGCOMM)},
  pages={236--252},
  year={2018},
  organization={ACM}
}

AWStream:

They propose a programming abstraction that allows developers to define
what degradation can happen on the streams. Then they automatically (using
offline and online profiling) dynamically decide how much to degrade
the input to optimize and match the given bandwidth.

This is a very good paper. They have a very solid evaluation, and a very
strong motivation section. They motivate AWStream (and the fact that it is
adaptive) by showing that bandwidth is scarce, but also unpredictable. They
have other papers and measurements of their own to show that.

In their evaluation they also compare against Jetstreams.

They explain why Manual policies (like in Jetstreams) are suboptimal. An excerpt
from JetStreams follows:

"if bandwidth is insufficient, switch to sending images
at 75 fidelity, then 50 if there still isn’t enough bandwidth.
Beyond that point, reduce the frame rate, but keep the im-
age fidelity."

First of all, changes in fidelity don't necessarily lead to the same changes
in application accuracy. **IDEA: This is why we need to be able to specify
the requirements of an application. Like we do for ordering, but for different
metrics. Actually we want some looser form of specification. Instead of
hard necessary requirements, we could design a soft type system, that shows
how changes in the input accuracy, fidelity, ordering (quality) affect the
application output.**

Second, rules are for one dimension at a time in JetStream, which is not
composable, and one has to manually write and tune the rules in all
dimensions so that they make sense.

Last, it is too low level to study and measure how each operator affects
the data stream.

Details of approach:
They find the Pareto optimal between Bandwidth need and Accuracy. Bandwidth
needs and Accuracy are initially measured while profiling, not assuming
that they have a closed form. They measure B(c) as the data rate at points of
transmission, and Accuracy is measured against the reference results, or the
ground truth (how?).

 acmid = {2616474},

}

JetStream:

They propose a system that focuses on processing streaming data that is in different locations.
The two main points of the system are aggregation and degradation. Aggregation is combining
data into succinct summaries, and degradation allows for reducing the data traded for reduced fidelity.

 -- !! Very important:
They make the claim, that as MapReduce aims to help developers by handling fault tolerance and
worker placement, JetStream aims to help by reducing the burden of sensing and responding to
bandwidth constraints.

They use a standard dataflow model for representing computation. The nodes of the dataflow graph
are operators, that can be placed in different workers (or in the same).

They represent data as Data Cubes which seem to be some form of aggregation of structured data.
Cubes seem to be indexed stores, that have many possible indexes and dimensions, so one could
ask questions using any subset/combination of indexes.

Aggregate functions that are applied on data-cubes must be order-independnent (?commutative?)

Note: It seems that their system is manual, in the sense that the user writes manually where
to instantiate an operator (on which node).

Conclusion:
In general this is a very nice paper, and it addresses an interesting problem. We should certainly
compare against it. This system doesn't seem to deal with order, but with relaxations related
to aggregating data.

Inspiration for future work:
It seems that their system uses online profiling, to understand when there are bandwidth issues, and
fixes them by applying the degradation operators. However several questions remain unanswered:

- How do different degradations compose. They could lead to arbitrary degradation. They are
  trying to do some steps toward that direction by defininf mergeability, which describes when
  two different degradations compose. However, this seems like a very surface level
  study of compositions of degradation operators.

- Another question, is how can one predict or constraint the amount of degradation used, or
  the amount of bandwidth saved. It would be interesting 1) to allow a user to specify what
  is acceptable degradation and what isn't (instead of just hoping that the applied degradation
  will not lead to problems in the resulting data), as well as 2) to have a model for how
  much bandwidth can be saved from each degradation, to apply them conciously, knowing the
  possible benefit.

SPADE:

This is a programming framework and system from IBM research. It is like many other
distributed stream processing systems. The user describes the computation using a
dataflow graph, and their systems does several optimizations for performance.

I don't see anything special in this system, but again it seems to have come before
all the Storm, Flink, etc...

year = {2018},
month = {October},
abstract = {Organizations deploy a hierarchy of clusters – cameras, private clusters, public clouds – for analyzing live video feeds from their cameras. Video analytics queries have many implementation options which impact their resource demands and accuracy of outputs. Our objective is to select the “query plan” – implementations (and their knobs) – and place it across the hierarchy of clusters, and merge common components across queries to maximize the average query accuracy. This is a challenging task, because we have to consider multi-resource (network and compute) demands and constraints in the hierarchical cluster and search in an exponentially large search space for plans, placements, and merging. We propose VideoEdge, a system that introduces dominant demand to identify the best tradeoff between multiple resources and accuracy, and narrows the search space by identifying a “Pareto band” of promising configurations. VideoEdge also balances the resource benefits and accuracy penalty of merging queries. Deployment results show that VideoEdge improves accuracy by 25.4 times and 5.4 times compared to fair allocation of resources and a recent solution for video query planning (VideoStorm), respectively, and is within 6% of optimum.},

*** Testing semantic properties of operators in dataflow programs (e.g. nondeterminism) ***

The first paper, which empirically categorizes nondeterministic reducers in production code, can be seen as a criticism of all the other papers in this section. The other papers test MapReduce code for violate certain semantic constraints, while the first points out that it's not so simple: many real-world programs do violate the semantic constraints, but are still correct and parallelism is still safe.

This last one is less of a user study, more a systematic study of various (50+) papers on testing MapReduce programs. Why people test MapReduce, what types of testing have been focused on, etc.

Quote: "Despite the type of testing, the majority of efforts are focused at the unit and integration test levels of the specific MapReduce functions without considering other parts of the technology stack."
