\begin{abstract}
The sheer scale of today's data processing needs has led to a new paradigm of software systems centered around requirements for high-throughput, distributed, low-latency computation.
Despite their widespread adoption, existing solutions have yet to provide a programming model with safe semantics -- and disagree on basic design choices, in particular with their approach to parallelism. As a result, \naive{} programmers are easily lead to make correctness and performance bugs.

This work proposes a reliable programming model for modern distributed stream processing, founded in a type system for \emph{partially ordered data streams}. On top of the core type system, we propose language abstractions for working with streams -- mechanisms to build stream operators with (1) type-safe compositionality, (2) deterministic distribution, (3) run-time testing, and (4) static performance bounds. Our thesis is that \emph{viewing streams as partially ordered conveniently exposes parallelism without compromising safety or determinism.} The ideas contained in this work are implemented in a series of open source software projects, including the Flumina, DiffStream, and Data Transducers libraries, and can be integrated with existing platforms.
