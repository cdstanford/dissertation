% Today, data is generated with higher velocity and higher volume than can be feasibly stored, raising the need for new algorithms, software abstractions, and systems.
The sheer scale of today's data processing needs has led to a new paradigm of software systems centered around requirements for high-throughput, distributed, low-latency computation.
Despite their widespread adoption, existing solutions have yet to provide a programming model with safe semantics -- and disagree on basic design choices, in particular with their approach to parallelism. As a result, \naive{} programmers are easily lead to make correctness and performance bugs.

This thesis proposes a reliable programming model for modern distributed stream processing, founded in a type system for \emph{partially ordered data streams}. On top of the core type system, we propose language abstractions for working with streams -- mechanisms to build stream operators with (1) type-safe compositionality, (2) deterministic distribution, (3) run-time testing, and (4) static performance bounds. Our thesis is that viewing streams as partially ordered conveniently exposes parallelism without compromising safety. The ideas contained in this work are implemented in a series of open source software projects, including the DiffStream, Flumina, and Data Transducers libraries, and can be integrated with existing platforms.
