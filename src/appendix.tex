\section{Word Clouds}

Here is a word cloud generated from all the text in this thesis.
I used the \githubref{https://github.com/amueller/word\_cloud}{\texttt{wordcloud\_cli} Python tool} on all \verb|.tex| sources and \verb|sed| to crudely filter out LaTeX-related words. In particular, I filtered out comments (anything after \verb|%|), commands (words starting with \verb|/|), and selected arguments
(contents inside \verb|\begin|, \verb|\end|, \verb|\label|, \verb|\ref|, \verb|\cite|, etc.).

And here is a word cloud for the references (bibliography) file.
This only includes text in the \verb|title=| and \verb|author=| fields.

\headerquote{The restriction of finiteness appears to give a better approximation to the idea of a physical machine. Of course, such machines cannot do as much as Turing machines, but the advantage of being able to compute an arbitrary general recursive function is questionable, since very few of these functions come up in practical applications.}{Rabin and Scott}
