Thank you to my wife Ariana, for joining forces with me to complete our PhDs together over the last six years.
I've had your boundless support during the most exciting days, the shared relaxing evenings, and the hardest nights.
I'll miss exploring Philadelphia with you; I'm looking forward to the next adventure.

I am grateful to my advisor, Rajeev, for his exceptional patience, and for teaching me most of what I know about research.
Following our first paper submission, when I came to Rajeev with a crazy idea for a better way to define automata for streaming, he believed in me and let me take the project in that direction.
When I fixated on technical details, Rajeev listened yet never lost sight of the bigger picture, and that has been invaluable to my work.

I've been fortunate to have many mentors at Penn. Thanks to Zack Ives, for his expertise in pragmatism; Benjamin Pierce, for teaching me how to think about programming languages and writing; Vincent Liu, for teaching me how to think about systems; and Val Tannen, who probably best understands what my research is trying to do (and always made the process of doing it thoroughly enjoyable).
Thank you to Stephanie Weirich and Steve Zdancewic for their advice on faculty interviews, for the board game night invites, and for taking the time to attend TGIF with students.
I also want to thank Kostas Mamouras, Scott Weinstein, and Sampath Kannan.
Thanks to my advisor at Amazon, Pauline Bolignano, for designing an internship which gave me close insight into what really matters to practitioners while still generating interesting research ideas; and to my advisors at Microsoft, Margus Veanes and Nikolaj Bjørner,
for being excited to talk about derivatives with me in spite of the pandemic, and for rapidly onboarding me on the Z3 project.

My life as a PhD student at Penn was made possible by the PLClub community.
I am grateful to Leo Lampropoulos, Antal Spector-Zabusky, Jennifer Paykin, Robert Rand, and Christine Rizkallah for making me feel included when I was most in doubt;
to Konstantinos Kallas and Filip Nikšić, who made research noticeably more enjoyable after they joined, through many whiteboard conversations, dinners, and drinks;
and to many other friends, but especially Suguman Bansal, Kishor Jothimurugan, Omar Navarro Leija, Yao Li, Solomon Maina, Li-yao Xia, and Anton Xue.

Outside of PLClub, thank you to all of my fellow CISDA volunteers -- especially Luke Valenta, Daphne Ippolito, Oshin Agarwal, Paul He, and Alyssa Hwang -- for their efforts to make the department a better place.
Not to mention Cheryl Hickey, for single-handedly holding the department together.
Thank you also to a number of other students and collaborators, including Ryan Beckett, Dana Fisman, Edo Roth, Zach Schutzman, Kelly Shiptoski, Jiali Xing, Nofel Yaseen, and Liangcheng Yu.
And thanks to Yu Chen for generously meeting with me to talk about online graph algorithms.
I'm sure I've forgotten someone, and I apologize!
I am also grateful for the many people outside of Penn who I have met at conferences over the years.

I am indebted to my close friends and family. Thank you to Kei Nishimura-Gasparian, Russell Shelp, and Frank Chung; my siblings, siblings-in-law, nieces, and nephews (MKZJTPT, JSSLCM, H, THL, BI, and E); all of my uncles, aunts, grandparents, and cousins; Pinto and Calcifer; and Alex Spentzos, for never running out of fun things to argue about, and for planning our wedding. In addition to Alex, my deep appreciation goes to Ariana's family, who welcomed me with open arms: Robin, Kyriakos, Sharon, Eric, Jasmin, Nathaniel, Michelle, Daniel, Aaron, Brian, and Cinder.

Some have sparked my love of thinking from the beginning.
Thank you, Mom and Dad (Kathleen and Joe);
Adella Croft, Michael Young, and Hiram Golze;
Canada/USA Mathcamp;
and Michael Zhao,
whose passion, intellect, and laughter I will always remember.
Thank you to my undergraduate mentors: Marion Scheepers, for a summer that made me certain that I wanted to do research as a career;
Tim Nelson, for getting me excited about logic for systems;
and Anna Lysyanskaya, who encouraged me and helped me apply to PhD programs in computer science seven years ago.
