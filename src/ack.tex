Thank you to my wife Ariana, for joining forces with me to complete our PhDs together over the last six years.
I've had your boundless support during the most exciting days, the many relaxing evenings, and the hardest nights.
I'll miss exploring Philadelphia together; I'm looking forward to the next adventure.

I owe a huge thanks to my advisor, Rajeev, for his exceptional patience, and for teaching me most of what I know about research.
Following our first paper submission, when I came to Rajeev with a crazy idea for a better definition of automata for streaming, he believed in me and let me take the project in that direction, eventually leading to my first paper at POPL in 2019.
When I ran into technical issues leading up to paper deadlines, he was available; he knew the bigger picture and where my work fit in.

I've benefited a great deal from my other mentors at Penn: especially Zack Ives, for his expertise in pragmatism; Benjamin Pierce, for teaching me how to think about programming languages; Vincent Liu, for teaching me how to think about systems; and Val Tannen, who probably best understands what my research is trying to do (and always made the process of doing it thoroughly enjoyable).
Thank you to Stephanie Weirich and Steve Zdancewic for their help and advice, for the board game night invites, and for taking the time to attend TGIF with students.
Thank you also to Kostas Mamouras, Scott Weinstein, and Sampath Kannan.
Thank you to my advisor at Amazon, Pauline Bolignano for designing an internship which gave me close insight into what does and doesn't matter to practitioners while still capturing an interesting research problem; and to my advisors at Microsoft, Margus Veanes and Nikolaj Bjørner, for their close collaboration and for rapidly onboarding me on the Z3 project.

My life as a PhD student at Penn was made possible by the PLClub community.
I am grateful especially to Leo Lampropoulos, Antal Spector-Zabusky, Jennifer Paykin, Robert Rand, ‪and Christine Rizkallah for making me feel included when I was most in doubt;
to Konstantinos Kallas and Filip Niksic, who made research noticeably more enjoyable after they joined, through many whiteboard conversations, dinners, and drinks;
and to Kishor Jothimurugan, Omar Navarro Leija, Yao Li, Solomon Maina, and Li-yao Xia for their friendship.
Thank you to all of my fellow CISDA volunteers -- especially Luke Valenta, Daphne Ippolito, Oshin Agarwal, Paul He, and Alyssa Hwang for their efforts to make the department a better place.
Not to mention Cheryl Hickey for single-handedly holding the department together.
Thank you to Suguman Bansal, Rado Ivanov, Anton Xue, Phillip Hilliard, and Chris Watson for their comeraderie.

Not to mention my wife's parents, Robin and Kirk, and other relatives Sharon, Eric, Jasmin, Nathaniel, Michelle, Daniel, Aaron, and Brian.
